title: Hello World!
---

I decided to revive the [viluon.me](http://viluon.me) domain using my long-forgotten GitHub pages. Recent conversations about computing, langdev in particular, motivated me to publish the few half-finished pseudo blog posts I've written and stored in [Obsidian](http://obisdian.md) over the past few months. Rather than being a purist about what I share, I decided to keep high-quality content for [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com) and upload my glorified notes to keep the conversation going. They are dated according to the time of writing.

So here goes nothing. I may get too embarrassed to keep myself from editing the blog posts after publication, so if anybody ever actually reads any of this and is keen to quote my ramblings, they should link to the exact commit in the [repo](https://github.com/viluon/viluon.github.io). Permalinks aren't permanent!

Cheers, [@viluon](https://keybase.io/viluon)
