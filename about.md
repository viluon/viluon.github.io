I'm a computer science student at [FIT CTU](https://old.fit.cvut.cz/en). I'm
passionate about the future of computing and programming languages, feel free
to [contact me](https://t.me/viluon) if you want to talk. I'm usually @viluon
on the Internet, see [Keybase](https://keybase.io/viluon) for a list of various
accounts.

If you're looking for someone to hire, be warned: my code is art. I'm not
claiming it is *good* art, but I often code just for the sake of it. I enjoy
programming as a means of self-expression and as something very playful. If
that excites you, we should talk. If you don't see value in creating "useless,"
toy programs (or -- similarly -- in learning to play a musical instrument),
then you are probably in search of a software engineer, and I don't think I fit
that description very well.
